You are tasked with completing a software development project that will be evaluated based on your GitHub repository, commit history, and deployed API. Follow these specific requirements to create an impressive submission:

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

Repository Setup: Create a well-structured GitHub repository with clear documentation
Commit Strategy: Demonstrate professional development practices through meaningful commit history
API Deployment: Deploy a publicly accessible API that evaluators can test
DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:

Phase 1: Repository Foundation

Initialize repository with descriptive README.md including project overview, setup instructions, and API documentation
Create proper project structure with organized folders (src/, docs/, tests/, etc.)
Add .gitignore file appropriate for your technology stack
Include LICENSE file if applicable
Phase 2: Development with Strategic Commits
Create commits that showcase your development process:

Initial project setup and configuration
Feature implementation in logical, incremental steps
Bug fixes and improvements
Code refactoring and optimization
Documentation updates
Testing implementation
Commit Best Practices:

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format
Make frequent, small commits rather than large monolithic ones
Include both feature development and maintenance commits
Show progression from basic functionality to advanced features
Phase 3: API Development & Documentation

Implement all required API endpoints

Add input validation and error handling
Implement proper HTTP status codes and responses
Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance

Write unit tests and integration tests
Include test coverage reports
Add continuous integration workflow (GitHub Actions)
Perform code quality checks
Phase 5: Deployment

Deploy to a reliable platform (Heroku, Vercel, Railway, or similar)
Ensure API is publicly accessible and testable
Include deployment URL in README
Test all endpoints post-deployment
DELIVERABLES:

GitHub repository URL with complete project
Deployed API URL that is publicly testable
Comprehensive documentation
Professional commit history demonstrating development expertise
